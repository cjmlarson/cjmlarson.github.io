"Saturday is Street Parade! It's going to be 95 degrees out and a million people will visit Zürich." Yeahhhhh... sounds like a great day to get out of the city and into the mountains!

_Climbing the SE ridge: a different type of party at sunrise_

It can often be hard to find tours with the SAC that (1) have space for an expat and (2) are on the weekend, but on Thursday afternoon, I was lucky to receive an email about a last-minute tour to the Saastal, in the Valais. I quickly signed up, got a confirmation, and threw my pack together.

I met the group for the 7:07am train from Zürich to Visp, an alpine weekend classic. Two hours later, after a high-speed ride past Bern and through the Lötschberg Base Tunnel, we arrived in the Valais. From there, a rather long Post Bus took us to car-free alpine town of Saas-Grund. (Unlike the neighboring Zermatt valley, there's no train in the Saastal).

By 10am, we were on our feet up the T2 trail to the Almagellerhütte. It was HOT - I wore Tevas and kept the boots in my pack (10/10 would recommend). The approach was relatively quick, even at a leisurely pace; we reached the hut in three and a half hours. The warden informed us that a full breakfast would be set out the next morning at 4am; a welcome surprise!

The next morning, we set off in the dark up the rocky SE ridge amidst plenty of company. A few people had bivouacked in a protected spot near the Zwischbergenpass; this seemed like a great idea for a later start on approach day (as the Almagellerhütte's 6pm dinner somewhat limits the after-work approach potential).

From the saddle, the route became less a defined path and more a rocky scramble. Aside from a bit of elevation-induced fatigue, though, it was not technically challenging. By 9am, we were essentially at the summit, and donned crampons for the last bit, a short traverse of an ice cap to the summit.

Descending is where the fun really started: the NW flank route leads over the steep, highly-crevassed Triftglescher. While graded as just PD, this was undoubtedly more demanding than the ascent. A slip would be problematic. Luckily, the conditions towards the top were great, with solid crampon grip and a nice footpath set over several busy days since the last storm a week prior.

Though some of the snow bridges on the lower section of the glacier were slightly hair-raising as the temperature rocketed up under the mid-day sun, the descent was pleasantly uneventful. Some fixed ropes on the steepest traversing sections were also a welcome find. Three hours later, we were back on terra firma at Hohsaas where cold beers awaited at the gondola top station!

Overall, I was stoked to tag another 4,000m peak on short notice and in great condition; thanks a ton to Walter, our tour leader, for organizing!

(Note: this tour could also easily be done in the reverse direction in a single-day push; on a hot day, this might even be preferable to clear the most highly crevassed and serac-exposed lower section of the Triftglescher before the mid-day heat.)
