I'm a second year MSc student studying in the Department of Math at ETH Zürich, in association with the Faculty of Business, Economics, and Informatics at the University of Zürich. My current interests include financial mathematics, commodity and prediction markets, and applications of artificial intelligence in business and management.

During my undergraduate work at Princeton, I studied Operations Research and Financial Engineering.
