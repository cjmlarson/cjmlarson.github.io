I'm a second year MSc student studying in the Department of Math at ETH Zürich, in association with the Faculty of Business, Economics, and Informatics at the University of Zürich. My current interests include financial mathematics, commodity and prediction markets, and applications of artificial intelligence in business and management.

During my undergraduate work at Princeton, I studied Operations Research and Financial Engineering. I was also captain of the Princeton Sailing team and lead tutor for Princeton's introductory microeconomics course, one of the largest courses on campus.

After Princeton, I spent two years as an Associate Consultant in Bain & Co.'s Private Equity Group working primarily on operational and commercial due diligences.

In my free time, I'm an avid endurance athlete and alpinist.
